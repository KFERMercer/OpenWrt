Subject: [PATCH] drm/v3d: Drop the wait for L2T flush to complete.

According to Dave, once you've started an L2T flush, all L2T accesses
will be blocked until the flush completes.  This fixes a consistent
3-4ms stall between the ioctl and running the job, and 3DMMES Taiji
goes from 27fps to 110fps.

v2: Leave a note about why we don't need to wait for completion.
