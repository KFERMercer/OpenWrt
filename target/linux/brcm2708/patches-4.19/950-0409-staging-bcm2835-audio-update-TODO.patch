Subject: [PATCH] staging: bcm2835-audio: update TODO

commit 01ec7398c56e8f1b903ecb3c5c75400e263eef43 upstream.

The following tasks were completed or not the right solution:

1/2- Not the proper solution, we should register a platform device in
vchiq the same way it's done with bcm2835-camera as commented here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/16/1131

2/3- Fixed by Takashi Iwai here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/4/587

Also, adds a new task as per mailing list conversation.

+1) Revisit multi-cards options and PCM route mixer control (as per comment
+https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/8/200)
 
-1) Document the device tree node
-
-The downstream tree(the tree that the driver was imported from) at
-http://www.github.com/raspberrypi/linux uses this node:
-
-audio: audio {
-	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-audio";
-	brcm,pwm-channels = <8>;
-};
-
-Since the driver requires the use of VCHIQ, it may be useful to have a link
-in the device tree to the VCHIQ driver.
-
-2) Gracefully handle the case where VCHIQ is missing from the device tree or
-it has not been initialized yet.
-
-3) Review error handling and remove duplicate code.
-
-4) Cleanup the logging mechanism.  The driver should probably be using the
-standard kernel logging mechanisms such as dev_info, dev_dbg, and friends.
-
-5) Fix the remaining checkpatch.pl errors and warnings.
+2) Fix the remaining checkpatch.pl errors and warnings.
