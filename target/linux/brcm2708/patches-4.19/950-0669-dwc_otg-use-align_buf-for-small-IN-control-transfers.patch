Subject: [PATCH] dwc_otg: use align_buf for small IN control transfers
 (#3150)

The hardware will do a 4-byte write to memory on any IN packet received
that is between 1 and 3 bytes long. This tramples memory in the uvcvideo
driver, as it uses a sequence of 1- and 2-byte control transfers to
query the min/max/range/step of each individual camera control and
gives us buffers that are offsets into a struct.

Catch small control transfers in the data phase and use the align_buf
to bounce the correct number of bytes into the URB's buffer.

In general, short packets on non-control endpoints should be OK as URBs
should have enough buffer space for a wMaxPacket size transfer.

See: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/3148
